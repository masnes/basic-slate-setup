# Getting Started with Slate

## Overview
Credit for most of this config and tutorial goes to 
Jed Northridge, his github page is [jedcn](https://github.com/jedcn).
View his excellent introduction to slate tutorial 
[Here](https://github.com/jedcn/getting-started-with-slate).

If you *have* heard of [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)
before, but found it inaccessible because it describes itself as:

> a bit daunting to get configured

Or, if you *have not* heard of [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)
before, but you are using MacOS **and**:

* You find it slightly irritating whenever you manually adjust the
  height and width of windows using a mouse

* You find yourself with a two display setup and you wish you could
  press a button and have an application jump between displays

* You find yourself pressing COMMAND + CONTROL to switch between
  applications, but sometimes you let go before you reach the one you
  want and have to start over again, or perhaps you "go past" the one
  you want and have to loop through again.

**Then you should read [Jed's Tutorial](https://github.com/jedcn/getting-started-with-slate)!**

**The goal of his project is to get you up and running with Slate in 10
or 15 minutes.**

Otherwise, if you have a working knowledge of slate and just want a basic config then
you're welcome to just use what's here. The mappings I'm using are listed 
below

I've updated Jed's setup to include the h and ; keys for window 
manipulation. ;, which was originally used for window selection, has 
been remapped to '.
